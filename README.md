  * README:
    * Description/instructions on how to use and run code
    * List of techs/languages/plugins/APIs used

      * Include links to the neatest parts of the code
      * Include screenshots of anything that looks pretty
    *future features
  * Go through the whole thing and refactor everything. There will be a lot of obvious things to refactor since you're a much better developer now.
  * Have only 1 class per file - no matter how small the class.
    * Name the files the same as the class (camel_cased).
  * Organize into /lib and /lib/pieces
  * Explain in README how someone would go about downloading and running this.
